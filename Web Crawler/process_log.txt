AI Log Entry – Displaying HTML Results Table Below Search Form

Prompt 
“Write a code to display the HTML results table below the events search. The displayed table includes five columns: Date, Icon, Event, Genre, and Venue. Add placeholders for the content for now.” I gave this prompt to the AI tool to generate starter HTML and CSS for the results section as required by the assignment spec (Section 2.2 Displaying Events Results).
Issue 
The generated table appeared to the right of the search form instead of below it. This happened because the AI’s HTML/CSS used the default inline display or an inline-block layout for the form and the table container, causing them to sit side-by-side horizontally rather than stacking vertically.
Fix 
I adjusted the layout to force a vertical stacking flow by updating the CSS as follows:
/* Ensure the results table is displayed below the search form */
#search-section, #results-section {
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
}

#results-section {
  margin-top: 20px;
  clear: both;
}

Explanation
The fix matters because the assignment requires the results table to appear directly below the search form (matching Figures 5 and 6 in the spec). Enforcing a vertical block or column layout ensures proper DOM flow and accessibility. This change improves the page’s usability and adheres to expected web-design semantics, where search input and its results follow a natural top-down order.
